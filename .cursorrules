# LinkWave Wireless - Web Development Rules

## Project Overview
This is a multi-page HTML website for LinkWave Wireless, a wireless network consulting company. The project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with external libraries (Swiper, Font Awesome, Google Fonts).

## Code Style & Standards

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, section, article, footer, etc.)
- Always include proper meta tags (charset, viewport)
- Use descriptive alt text for all images
- Maintain consistent indentation (spaces, not tabs)
- Keep HTML structure clean and well-organized
- Use meaningful class and ID names following BEM or similar naming conventions
- Ensure all links have proper href attributes
- Include lang attribute on html tag

### CSS
- Follow consistent naming conventions (use existing patterns in style.css)
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, spacing, and other repeated values
- Write mobile-first responsive CSS
- Use flexbox and grid appropriately
- Keep styles organized by component/section

## Colors

### Color Philosophy
Colors affect us in many different ways but all colors create a specific frame of mind for people–it's called a mood. Having people be in the most receptive mood is essential for their engagement with your brand. Color sets the mood of brand expression, and more importantly, creates mental associations to the meaning of your brand within the context of the world it lives in.

### Brand Color Palette

**Sandy Orange** - `#FF9E4E`
- Represents energy and innovation, reflecting Linkwave's focus on cutting-edge wireless solutions in a dynamic and approachable way
- Use for: Accent elements, highlights, energetic sections

**Dark Purple** - `#200029`
- Symbolizes expertise and stability, reinforcing Linkwave's trusted reputation with a touch of sophistication
- Use for: Primary backgrounds, headers, professional elements, main navigation

**Pumpkin** - `#F57822`
- Bold and attention-grabbing, Pumpkin highlights Linkwave's proactive approach
- Use for: Call-to-action (CTA) buttons, important interactive elements, emphasis points

**White Smoke** - `#F4F4F4`
- A clean, neutral tone that adds clarity and balance, ensuring focus on key messaging and a professional look
- Use for: Backgrounds, card backgrounds, subtle dividers, neutral spaces

### Color Usage Guidelines
- Always use the exact hex codes provided above
- Ensure proper contrast ratios when using colors for text (WCAG AA minimum)
- Use Pumpkin (#F57822) specifically for CTAs and primary action buttons
- Dark Purple (#200029) should be used sparingly for maximum impact
- White Smoke (#F4F4F4) provides balance and should be used to create visual breathing room
- Sandy Orange (#FF9E4E) works well for secondary accents and highlights

## Typography

### Typography Philosophy
Typography is a powerful tool to maintain brand consistency. Together, these fonts form a cohesive, professional typographic system that enhances Linkwave's brand identity.

### Brand Typography System

**Inter - Titles and Headings**
- **Use:** All titles and headings (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, section titles, card titles)
- **Weight:** Various weights (400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900) depending on hierarchy
- **Purpose:** Inter provides a modern, professional look for all titles and headings, ensuring consistency across the site

**Poppins - Body Text and Small Text**
- **Use:** Body text, paragraphs, descriptions, small text, supporting copy, and all non-heading content
- **Weight:** Regular / 400 (and lighter weights 300 for small text when needed)
- **Line Height:** 1.4em (or appropriate for readability)
- **Letter Spacing:** 0%
- **Style:** None (standard case)
- **Purpose:** Clean, straightforward design ensures readability, allowing detailed information to be conveyed clearly and consistently

### Typography Usage Guidelines
- Always use Inter font family for all titles and headings (h1-h6)
- Always use Poppins font family for body text, paragraphs, and small text
- Use appropriate font weights to establish visual hierarchy
- Maintain consistent line heights for readability
- Ensure proper font loading with Google Fonts preconnect
- Use semantic HTML heading tags (h1, h2, h3, etc.) to maintain hierarchy
- Test typography at different screen sizes to ensure readability
- Maintain the specified line heights and letter spacing for consistency
- Ensure proper font loading with Google Fonts preconnect
- Use semantic HTML heading tags (h1, h2, h3, etc.) to maintain hierarchy
- Test typography at different screen sizes to ensure readability

## Logo

### Logo Spacing Guidelines

**Minimum Size**
- To maintain full legibility, the minimum size at which the logo may appear is 2" (approximately 144-192px) in width for all printing materials
- For web/digital use, maintain a minimum width that ensures the logo remains legible and recognizable (typically 120-150px minimum)
- There is no maximum size limit, but use discretion when sizing the logo
- The logo should never be the most dominant element on the page, but instead should live comfortably and clearly as an identifying mark
- The minimum size guideline applies only to the primary logo, not the icon if used on its own

**Clear Space**
- To protect the brand visual integrity, the logo should be sufficiently isolated from illustrations, texts, and images that might detract from its prominence
- To ensure that clear space is maintained around the logo for legibility and prominence, all graphic elements must follow the guidelines illustrated here
- The required clear space around the logo on all sides should be equal to the width (or height) of the orange wireless signal icon (the 'i' dot from the logo)
- Use the width of the surrounding clear space lines as a measuring tool to help maintain clearance
- No text, images, or other graphic elements should intrude into this clear space area

### Approved Logo Color Variations

**Contrast Philosophy**
Contrast is the spice that makes your brand visually appetizing. Logos and color variations with ample contrast don't just stand out; they're easier to read and more accessible, especially for those with visual impairments. High contrast ensures that your brand remains impactful across various backgrounds, be it a dark-themed website or a light-colored brochure. It's like wearing a tuxedo to a black-tie event; you not only fit in, but you also stand out.

**Approved Variations:**

1. **On White/White Smoke (#F4F4F4) backgrounds:**
   - Full logo in black (text and wireless signal icon)
   - Logo text in black with Sandy Orange (#FF9E4E) wireless signal icon
   - Full logo in Sandy Orange (#FF9E4E)

2. **On Sandy Orange (#FF9E4E) background:**
   - Full logo in Dark Purple (#200029)

3. **On Pumpkin (#F57822) background:**
   - Full logo in Dark Purple (#200029)

4. **On Dark Purple (#200029) background:**
   - Logo text in White Smoke (#F4F4F4) with Sandy Orange (#FF9E4E) wireless signal icon

### Colors to Avoid

**Why Poor Contrast Should Be Avoided**
Poor contrast strains the eyes, dilutes brand impact, makes elements less memorable, and can alienate audiences, especially those with visual impairments. In a digital world, poor contrast can lead to a scroll past rather than engagement.

**Avoid These Combinations:**
- Light orange/muted orange logo on dark backgrounds (low contrast)
- Muted orange logo on dark purple background (very low contrast)
- Light orange logo on white background (extremely low contrast, almost invisible)
- Any color combination that doesn't meet WCAG AA contrast ratio standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)

**Contrast Testing:**
- Always test logo contrast against its background
- Ensure minimum WCAG AA contrast ratios are met
- When in doubt, use approved color variations listed above
- Test logo visibility on both light and dark backgrounds
- Consider users with visual impairments when selecting color combinations

### Logo Usage Guidelines
- Always maintain the minimum size requirements to ensure legibility
- Always respect the clear space requirements around the logo
- Ensure the logo has sufficient contrast against its background
- Only use approved color variations listed above
- Do not distort, rotate, or modify the logo proportions
- Use the full logo (with "WIRELESS SOLUTIONS INC.") when space allows
- Maintain consistent logo placement across all pages (typically in header/navigation)
- Test logo contrast in different lighting conditions and on various devices

- Maintain a confident, professional tone throughout all photography

**Color Integration**
- Subtly incorporate vibrant accent colors (Sandy Orange #FF9E4E, Dark Purple #200029, Pumpkin #F57822) to maintain cohesive visual identity
- Use brand colors as overlays, UI elements, or environmental accents when appropriate
- Ensure brand colors appear naturally within the context of technology, equipment, or interfaces
